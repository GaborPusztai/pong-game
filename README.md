ZTM - Course project </br>
A classic Pong game built using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project features a simple two-player gameplay where each player controls a paddle to hit a ball back and forth. The game includes basic scoring, paddle movement, and ball bouncing mechanics. It serves as a fun introduction to game development and the use of the HTML5 <canvas> element for rendering game graphics.
